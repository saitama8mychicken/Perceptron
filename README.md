# Perceptron
## Single Layer Perceptron

he computation of a single layer perceptron is performed over the calculation of sum of the input vector each with the value multiplied by corresponding element of vector of the weights. The value which is displayed in the output will be the input of an activation function

In the above two single layer perceptrons have been designed

1 - Single layer perceptron for housing data
